# beadPattern
This code will create a simple window with an input field where you can enter the pixel size and a button to select an image. When you click the "Select Image" button, it will open a file dialog where you can choose an image file. Then it processes the image and saves the bead pattern as a new image, and updates a label in the window to inform you that the pattern has been saved.
